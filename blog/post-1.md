Hi there!

Today, I’m writing the first edition of **Diary of a Product Manager**. 

My intention here is to share and connect with you by exposing my thoughts, struggles, ideas—maybe even trauma dumping sometimes. 

As a fairly introverted person, I hope, by sharing sides of me that aren’t exclusively professional, to be seen as a relatable person rather than just a PM.

I also see this space as an opportunity to reconnect with the act of writing.

So, I want to wish you a warm welcome to my world. Stay tuned for the next post, where I’ll introduce myself more thoroughly.

Cheers!
